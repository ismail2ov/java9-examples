/**
 * A JUnit (5) test case providing examples of the enhancements that have been made to Java interfaces in Java 9 (J9).
 */
class JavaInterfaceEnhancementsTest {

  /**
   * Java 9 now permits the use of private, instance or static, methods in interfaces. This allows concrete 'default'
   * (public) and static interface methods, introduced in Java 8, to share common code without making that code
   * public. (It is still the case that Java interfaces are stateless).
   * <p>
   * For an example application of these new features see the {@link Logger} interface below.
   *
   * <h2>Evolution of Behaviour in Java interfaces</h2>
   * Up to and including Java 7, interfaces could only contain public abstract methods - no behaviour. ('public
   * abstract' remains the default access modifiers for interface methods).
   * <p>
   * Java 8 changed this, adding support for behaviour in interfaces in two ways. Firstly, 'default' methods were
   * added to support declaring a (public) abstract method with a default implementation. (The main motivation for
   * this was to support extending interfaces in the standard Java library without breaking backwards compatibility,
   * e.g. to retrofit Collection APIs with methods that accept Lambdas/Functional Interfaces). Secondly, Java 8 also
   * permitted the use of concrete, public static (only) methods in interfaces. This removed the need to create
   * companion static classes for utility methods. (For examples of Java 8 default methods see my
   * <a href="https://bitbucket.org/neilbrown/java8-examples">java8-examples project</a>.).
   * <p>
   * As noted above, Java 9 has now taken this further, now also permitting the use of _private_, static or instance
   * methods, in interfaces.
