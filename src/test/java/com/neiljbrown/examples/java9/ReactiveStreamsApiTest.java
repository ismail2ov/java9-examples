/**
 * <a href="http://www.reactive-streams.org/">Reactive Streams</a> is an initiative to define a standard for the async
 * exchange of data between components within an application, with the aim of making more efficient use of resources,
 * by avoiding blocking (waiting on I/O), and with support for flow-control between the data producer and consumer
 * (referred to as 'back-pressure'). It resulted in a specification and a set of abstract programming APIs for each
 * supported development platform, including Java, in the form of small no. of interfaces. Subsequent implementations
 * of the Reactive Streams spec. each shipped with their own, duplicate set of these interfaces. Java 9 now provides a
 * standard set of the Reactive interfaces as part of the Java language in the {@link java.util.concurrent.Flow} class.
 * Additionally, Java 9 also provides a powerful implementation of the reactive
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.Flow.Publisher} interface, in the form of {@link SubmissionPublisher}.
 * <p>
 * This class contains a couple of examples of how to process data in a reactive fashion using the new Java 9 version
 * of the reactive interfaces.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note</strong> - The Reactive Streams APIs are primarily designed for use by vendors / providers of products
 * such a web-servers, data-stores, etc, rather than application developers. Application developers will instead
 * typically build on top of reactive frameworks that use these products.
