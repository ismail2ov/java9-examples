/**
 * A JUnit (5) test case providing examples of how some of the main collection classes have been enhanced to provide
 * static factory methods to simplify the code for creating <i>immutable</i> collections.
 * <p>
 * Note, that these new factory methods are <i>not</i> defined on the {@link java.util.Collection} interface, or part
 * of the {@link java.util.Collections} utility class, but have rather been retrofitted on selective collection
 * interfaces - {@link java.util.List}, {@link java.util.Set} and {@link java.util.Map}. This has been achieved
 * without breaking backwards compatibility by providing 'defaultâ€™ method implementations in List, Set and Map
 * interfaces.
 * <p>
 * There are no. of overloaded versions of these static factory methods each accepting an increasing no. of collection
 * elements, plus a varargs version of the method supporting an arbitrary no. of elements.
