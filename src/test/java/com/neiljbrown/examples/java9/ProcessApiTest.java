/**
 * A JUnit (5) test case providing examples of the enhancements that have been made to the Process API in Java 9.
 * <p>
 * Java 9 has been extended to make it easier to query (find and list) and obtain info about native processes. The
 * support is provided by the new {@link ProcessHandle} interface. Some of these new features have also been exposed
 * by adding new methods to the existing {@link Process} (abstract) class.
 * <p>
 * As detailed in its Javadoc, the new {@link ProcessHandle} interface identifies and provides control of native
 * processes. Each individual process can be monitored to see if it's still alive, list its children, get information
 * about the process or destroy it. (Instances of {@link Process} continue to be used to additionally provide access
 * to the input, output, and error streams of a process).
 * <p>
 * One of the benefits of these enhancements is that is that it will encourage building tools in Java for process
 * management e.g. for application monitoring/management and deployment.
 *
 * <h2>Querying Processes</h2>
 * The new support for querying native processes makes it easier to find a (e.g. current, parent, child or any) process
 * (handle) and obtain info about it, such as its PID, name, arguments, start time and CPU usage, etc.
 *
 * <h2>Managing / Controlling Processes</h2>
 * New support in Java 9 for managing / controlling processes is limited to providing the ability to register functions
 * or actions to execute synchronously or asynchronously upon process termination (see
 * {@link ProcessHandle#onExit() and equivalent {@link Process#onExit()}}.
 * <p>
 * The new ProcessHandle interface also supports killing processes using {@link ProcessHandle#destroy()} and
 * {@link ProcessHandle#destroyForcibly()}, however, these methods were already provided by {@link Process} in Java 8.
 * <p>
 * The {@link ProcessBuilder} class, added in Java 5, continues to be the best way to create/run new processes. Java 9
 * has added one new method to this class which supports chaining together the execution of a series of processes,
 * linking them by their standard output and input streams. See {@link ProcessBuilder#startPipeline(List)}.

   * process. There are other factory methods, including {@link ProcessHandle#of(long)} which supports obtaining the
   * ProcessHandle of any process identified by PID, if it exists, and {@link ProcessHandle#parent()} which supports
   * obtaining the ProcessHandle of the parent process, if there is one.
